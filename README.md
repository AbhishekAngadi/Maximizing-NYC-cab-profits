# Maximizing-NYC-cab-profits

This project is the analysis of NYC cabs travel routes and fares earned. It further provides Recommendations to maximize profits earned and optimizing routes.

### Observations and Hypothesis:

1. People definitely prefer short distances over long distances. That's probably because of two reasons: Longer distances are extremely expensive. NY subway or driving their own car would be much cheaper. Secondly, longer distances could also mean increased traffic and longer trip times. NY subway would be a faster means of transport.
2. The longest rides are taken early in the morning. Evenings have comparatively longer rides too. Hours between 9 and 7 have short rides taken. People take cabs to work to ensure they reach on time. Also, they take cab back home when it's really late.Â People do not take cab back home from work, if they leave on time. Since probably there is no urgency of reaching on time, they take the subway or other form of public transport



### Recommendation 1:
Drop Fare Amounts for Airport Trips and try capturing larger market share
### Recommendation 2:
Increase number of taxis at locations across NYC as per hour of the day. Also, cash tips need be tracked as well.

### FUTURE SCOPE 1:
Analyze data with other months and more importantly later year. Is there a drop is usage because of Uber/Lfyt?
### FUTURE SCOPE 2:
Anomaly Detection
